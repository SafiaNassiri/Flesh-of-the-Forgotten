NOTES FOR IMPLEMENTATION

Godling Banter: Every choice has an orange-text reaction, even minor ones.

Mutation Tracking: At certain Bond thresholds, Kael’s descriptions change — claws, black veins, distorted voice.

Dynamic Narration: Morality shifts subtly change narrator tone (white text) to be more hopeful or hopeless.
